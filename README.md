# Personal Website With GitHub repository information and Google Analytics Site Tracking

This project was started to learn Angular and Web Development concepts and to create an interactive personal website.

Twilio and nodemailer were used to send texts/emails for user feedback and contact purposes. A local SQL DB was used to log user feedback and GitHubs API was used for near real-time statistics.

This is the front-end for the website, see the back end [here](https://github.com/spaulsteinberg/website_server).
